## Adding results to HepLean

This assumes you have already installed Lean and setup HepLean. 

To add a result to HepLean:

- Create a new branch of HepLean.
- Name the branch something which tells people what sort of things you are adding e.g. "StandardModel-HiggsPotential"
- On pushing to a brach GitHub will run a number of continous integration checks on your code.
- Once you are happy, and your branch has passed the continous integration checks, make a pull-request to the main branch of HepLean.
