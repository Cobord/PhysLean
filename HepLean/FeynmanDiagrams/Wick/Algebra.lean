# Operator algebra

Currently this file is only for an example of Wick strings, correpsonding to a
theory with two complex scalar fields. The concepts will however generalize.

This file is currently a stub.

We will formally define the operator ring, in terms of the fields present in the theory.

  math :≈ "
    Modifications of this may be needed.
    A structure with the following data:
    - A ℤ₂-graded algebra A.
    - A map from `ψ : 𝓔 × SpaceTime → A` where 𝓔 are field colors.
    - A map `ψc : 𝓔 × SpaceTime → A`.
    - A map `ψd : 𝓔 × SpaceTime → A`.
    Subject to the conditions:
    - The sum of `ψc` and `ψd` is `ψ`.
    - Two fields super-commute if there colors are not dual to each other.
    - The super-commutator of two fields is always in the
      center of the algebra. "
