# Involutions

There is an isomorphism between the type of contractions of a list `l` and
the type of involutions from `Fin l.length` to `Fin l.length`.

Likewise, there is an isomorphism from the type of full contractions of a list `l`
and the type of fixed-point free involutions from `Fin l.length` to `Fin l.length`.

Given this, the number of full contractions of a list `l` is
is given by the OEIS sequence A000085.
