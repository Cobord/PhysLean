# Feynman diagrams

This file currently contains a lighter implmentation of Feynman digrams than can be found in
`HepLean.PerturbationTheory.FeynmanDiagrams.Basic`. Eventually this will superseed that file.

The implmentation here is done in conjunction with Wicks species etc.

This file is currently a stub.
