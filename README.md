# High Energy Physics in Lean

## Aims of this project

- Use Lean to create a exhaustive database of definitions, theorems, proofs and calculations in high energy physics.
- Keep the database up-to date with developments in MathLib4. 
- Create github workflows of relevence to the high energy physics community.
